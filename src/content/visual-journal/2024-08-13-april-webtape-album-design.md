April’s second album, _webtape_, is officially out! I worked closely with the band to design the CD and ensure the packaging visually represented _webtape_ conceptually, much of which was wrapped in layers of nostalgia. So much love went into this album and it was inspiring to see full album come together. 

You can now purchase a physical copy of the CD on [Bandcamp](https://listentoapril.bandcamp.com/album/webtape) and you can listen to it wherever you stream music.
