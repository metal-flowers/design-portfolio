Snippets from my final Term 1 project for Type West! Together, we spent the first 10-week term working on type revivals. We had to submit process book pdfs at the end of the term and wanted to print and bind mine here for some closure. Excuse the poor printing, I have since upgraded my printer for a higher res one. You can see the project (and my fellow colleagues) up on the [Letterform Archive](https://typewest.letterformarchive.org/2024/revivals/) and a slightly more in-depth version [here](https://annieszafranski.com/projects/beatrice-no-30-type-revival/).
