It’s out! It’s out! And so worth the wait. I've been dropping the Taxes singles here as they come out, but this month we are blessed with the full Retirement Home album. And it's. so. freaking. good. I got to listen to the album while working on the design and I can't tell you how many times I've listened to this already. You can stream it wherever you stream music. 

I wrote a short little [portfolio update](https://annieszafranski.com/projects/taxes-retirement-home-album-design) on it, but there's still a good amount I want to add before I call it finished but I wanted to get it added. Artwork is by Sam Bee and was commissioned by Taxes for this album.

Please listen and enjoy!
