Work samples from a typographic pitch for a Little Dame project back in October. The type is set in Temporary Display, a typeface designed by [Jonathan Maghen](http://jonathanmaghen.com/) and Sam Wagner; available at [Primary Type Foundry](http://primary-foundry.com/). I thought it would be perfect to use for temporary signage and graphics for Little Dame to communicate their fundraising campaign goals as well as progress as they build out their new space.
