Well, even though I am very casually working on my next [DRONE(((E)))SCAPES](https://www.annieszafranski.com/visual-journal/drone-e-scapes) (this is generous), I wanted to make something else that could technically help me with my next song but be different from the music I'm trying to make. But honestly, I was also just listening to music while playing video games (literally…Sonic) and was ultimately inspired to make a mix. 

So this is my first official stab at making one for the sake of a good time. I bring you Sonic Zones; it's a short 45-minute mix combining house, techno, and new wave. You can listen to it on [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/metal-flowers/soniczones-september-21/).
