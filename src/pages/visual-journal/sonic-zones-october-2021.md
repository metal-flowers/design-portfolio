I'm not planning to make a mix every month or anything, but I had to do another mix for October since it's my favorite month. I have full permission to add dark and spooky jams without judgement, and I did. Mix includes some techno, industrial, and dark wave with some classic horror movie soundtrack snippets sprinkled throughout. It's a fun one if you're into that.
