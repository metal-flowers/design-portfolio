April’s Second album, _webtape_, is officially released! So much love and work went into this album and it was inspiring to see the process up close. I worked closely with April to design the CD and made sure it visually represented _webtape_ conceptually. You can now purchase a physical copy of the CD on [Bandcamp]("https://listentoapril.bandcamp.com/album/webtape") and you can listen to it [here]("https://open.spotify.com/album/6nsas45yxo0GbpytTmM5iP?si=mkzsccTWQsmcIPaDKRMuEg"), or wherever you stream your music.
