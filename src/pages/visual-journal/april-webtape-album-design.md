April’s second album, _webtape_, is officially out! I worked closely with the band to design the CD and ensure the packaging visually represented _webtape_ conceptually. So much love went into this album and it was inspiring to see full album come together. 

You can now purchase a physical copy of the CD on [Bandcamp]("https://listentoapril.bandcamp.com/album/webtape") and you can listen to it [here]("https://open.spotify.com/album/6nsas45yxo0GbpytTmM5iP?si=mkzsccTWQsmcIPaDKRMuEg"), or wherever you stream music.
