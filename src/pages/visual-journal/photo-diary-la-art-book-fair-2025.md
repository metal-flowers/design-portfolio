This year, the LA Art Book Fair was held at the ArtCenter campus in Pasadena. I wasn't originally planning to go, but I couldn't resist a trip up and went on the final day. Rather than spend the day anxiously trying to see everything, I spent most of my time in the letterpress studio on campusâ€”the home of <a href="https://www.artcenter.edu/about/campus/south-campus/facilities/archetype-press.html">Archetype Press.</a>

With a spot on the list and a donation, I participated in the small workshop put together by the lovely folks at <a href="https://draw-down.com/">Draw Down Books</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/archetype_press_artcenter/">Archetype Press.</a> Together, we selected type from a limited pre-selection of fonts from Archetype Press' collection of metal and wood type. With font selections made and typeset, we constructed a collaborative poster and each printed a small set of them on the press. I managed to get a few photos on film while I was there.

The poster itself (pictured above, out of focus) was designed by Christopher and Kathleen Sleboda of Draw Down Books (who also designed the <a href="https://www.printedmatter.org/programs/events/2007">LA Art Book Fair</a> identity), and typeset by those of us in the workshop, and of course, Archetype Press.

Everyone involved was so kind and generous with their time, and happily shared their knowledge. It was a different way to experience the art book fair, and one I quite appreciated. It was energizing and exciting to be surrounded by so much type, numerous letterpress machines, and cool people who have spent time learning the craft and are sharing it with fellow type and print lovers. 

There's more I could easily add, but I like to keep things short here and have already gone over. It was definitely worth the trip up!
