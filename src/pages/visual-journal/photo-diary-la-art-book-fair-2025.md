This year, the LA Art Book Fair was held at the ArtCenter campus in Pasadena. I wasn't originally planning to go, but I couldn't resist a trip up and went on the final day. Rather than spend the day anxiously trying to see everything, I spent most of my time in the letterpress studio on campusâ€”the home of <a href="https://www.artcenter.edu/about/campus/south-campus/facilities/archetype-press.html">Archetype Press.</a>

With limited sign-up spots and a donation, I participated in the small workshop put together by the lovely folks at <a href="https://draw-down.com/">Draw Down Books</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/archetype_press_artcenter/">Archetype Press.</a> Together, we selected type from a limited pre-selection of fonts from Archetype Press' extensive collection of metal and wood type. With font selections made and typeset, we constructed a collaborative poster and each printed a small set of them on the press.

I brought my film camera in and snapped a few photos to capture the moment and the space, the ones in this post are my favorite. They're not perfect, but neither are some of the prints. Sometimes the ink will smudge or not be fully spread, and sometimes the photo is unfortunately out of focus (I excluded most of those though). The poster itself was designed by Christopher and Kathleen Sleboda of Draw Down Books (who also designed the <a href="https://www.printedmatter.org/programs/events/2007">LA Art Book Fair</a> identity), and typeset by those of us in the workshop, and of course, Archetype Press.

Everyone involved was so kind and generous with their time, and happily shared their knowledge. It was a different way to experience the art book fair, and one I quite appreciated. It was energizing and exciting to be surrounded by so much type, letterpress machines, and people who have spent time learning the craft and sharing it with fellow type and print lovers. 

I have more I could easily say, but I like to keep things short here. It was definitely worth the trip up!
