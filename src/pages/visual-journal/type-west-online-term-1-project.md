Some snippets from my final Term 1 project for Type West! Spent the first 10-week term working on type revivals. You can see the project (and my fellow colleagues) up on the [Letterform Archive]("https://typewest.letterformarchive.org/2024/revivals/")and and slightly more in-depth description and more photos of my project [here]("https://www.annieszafranski.com/projects/beatrice-no-30-type-revival")
