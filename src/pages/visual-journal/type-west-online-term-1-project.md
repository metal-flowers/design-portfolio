Snippets from my final Term 1 project for Type West! Together, we spent the first 10-week term working on type revivals. You can see the project (and my fellow colleagues) up on the [Letterform Archive](https://typewest.letterformarchive.org/2024/revivals/) and a slightly more in-depth version [here](https://annieszafranski.com/projects/beatrice-no-30-type-revival/).
