Some recent type play! I decided to quickly make a set of uppercase serif letterforms to experiment with making a serif font for the first time. I did this using components in Glyphs, thinking about shared shapes, and bringing type out of the computer and back onto paper. I started with sketches and moved forward quickly to start making and building in Glyphs. I later went back to paper to cut shapes early on to understand how the type was working. I kept tweaking my letterforms, printing them, and later slicing each grouping into its color to help visualize and reiterate the concept that type is its system, and visually display that through color.  

Though this is supposed to be a helpful and playful learning aid, this is a first pass, and I do want to improve the visuals and work more on this type I started constructing. Just thought I'd share this fun exercise. Inspired by the [Intro to Modern Type Design workshop]("https://www.annieszafranski.com/visual-journal/marlborough-titling") I took through Letterform Archive earlier this year!
