In a somewhat recent night when my mind and body simply would not let me sleep until 5am, I was thinking about the great [Ed Ruscha](https://edruscha.com/) and some of his beautiful and delicate [work](https://edruscha.com/works/hey-2-2/) work with [graphite](https://edruscha.com/works/annie-2-2/). It was a random thought, but certainly a welcomed one (they're rarely so generous), as it inspired me to open a sketchbook for the first time in years. 

Since that night, I've spent a good chunk of January just drawing a variety of movie titles I've [watched recently](https://letterboxd.com/aszaf/) to get back into sketching and practicing some letterforms. This has been really helpful to just get myself to show up and learn how to see, sketch, and play again, even if it’s not making anything new. They're far from perfect (especially seeing them scanned in), but it's not too bad either for not sketching anything for way too long!
