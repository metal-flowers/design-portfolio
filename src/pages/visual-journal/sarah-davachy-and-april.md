My good friends in the band April are playing a new show this month on <a href="https://digitalgym.org/movies/live-sound-bath-sarah-davachi-and-april/">Saturday, April 19th at Digital Gym</a> in San Diego. They'll be opening for <a href="https://www.sarahdavachi.com/">Sarah Davachi</a>, who will perform her piece, <a href="https://sarahdavachi.bandcamp.com/album/music-for-a-bellowing-room"> Music for a Bellowing Room</a>, and April will be performing songs from <a href="https://listentoapril.bandcamp.com/album/webtape"> Webtape</a> (and potentially some new ones). 

I was thrilled to make the poster for the event, knowing I'd find inspiration from her compositions, and later from old 19th century printing borders and ornamentation. I used contemporary type from Blaze Type, Overlap Type, and a Goudy revival. Together, I found they all work nicely together in an elegant manner.

With film by Dicky Bahto. Opening performance by April. Live audio visual sound bath: Saturday April 19th. Digital Gym San Diego. 4:30pm and 7pm. digitalgym.org.">

This show is a bit unique because there will be an attached market happening in the lobby of the event, with different types of local vendors. This meant designing promotional material for two separate events, while still keeping them visually connected. To do that, I used the same type selections throughout (except for <a href="https://blazetype.eu/typefaces/emeritus">Emeritus</a>) (with some changes), while keeping consistent colors and a similar illustration style (and within public domain). There are many varying assets across instagram posts, ads, flyers around town, and a nice poster for the event, but wanted to quickly share these instagram posts.
