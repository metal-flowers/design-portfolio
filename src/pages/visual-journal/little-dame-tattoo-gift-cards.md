When local business after local business began shutting their doors mid-March to comply with local and state government, Little Dame was no different. With the temporary closure of Little Dame and the brand new tattoo shop within it, I worked quickly with the shop owners to get some tattoo gift cards designed to help support the two artists, who would normally be tattooing, with the hopes of offering some immediate support. 

I’ve already purchased a gift card, but I may purchase another one soon! If you’re local, out of town and want to plan a visit to the shop, or want to help support the tattoo artists and have the means to do so—you can do so on the little dame website. You can also find some unique items through their online shop while their retail store is closed.
