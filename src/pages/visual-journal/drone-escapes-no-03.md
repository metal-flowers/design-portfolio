I started this 46 minute track about 5 months ago, but after I initially recorded it and had the tracks in Ableton I had to hop on a plane to NY for a week for some work stuff. I wasn't really able to settle back into it since, unfortunately, until the end of August. My PMDD was fucking me up and I just needed this because I still rely on listening to the [first](https://www.mixcloud.com/metal-flowers/droneescapes/) [two](https://www.mixcloud.com/metal-flowers/droneescapes-no02/) tracks I made and wanted more. 

I gave myself a short window to edit because I don't like to tinker on things forever, so it isn't exactly what I want, but I'm new here and I'll put that into the next one. I'm already thinking about it and getting excited because I'm going to change it up a bit. You can listen to the full track on [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/metal-flowers/droneescapes-no-03/).

For the artwork, I modified _The Agony in the Garden_ by William Blake, c. 1799â€“1800. Typography is VCTR Mono v0.12 (previously ISO) by Vectro type.
