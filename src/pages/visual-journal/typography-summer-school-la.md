Final project snippets from the [Typography Summer School](http://typographysummerschool.org/) LA intensive from earlier this summer. 2 days of Lectures/discussion/sharing in between 2 projects, with [Faser Muggeridge](https://www.instagram.com/frasermuggeridgestudio/?hl=en) and [Benjamin Critton.](https://www.instagram.com/benjamincritton/?hl=en) Hosted at the Compass office in Hollywood. 

Project 1: Wikipedia (Day 1): I chose the [Public Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library) wiki page to design in print form.

Project 2: Type Hack (Day 2): I decided to make Gill Sans disappear.

The projects aren’t perfect, but they were completed in the short amount of time we had, so its all in good fun and was a fun and refreshing experience with this whole workshop crew!
