You know when you just need to make something and can’t focus on anything else until it’s done? That was me for a week, working on this new mix. I had a window of time to work on it and became obsessed with it in the best way. I haven’t made one for 3 years, so I kept it pretty simple by keeping it to 1 hour, using fewer songs, and focusing more on the transitions after learning from the last few. You can listen to the
[August ’25 Mix here](https://www.mixcloud.com/metal-flowers/soniczones-aug-2025/).

I went the dark wave, EBM, and gothy route for this one—inspired by The Coffin Club in Portland—and had a blast doing so. I love the process for these because I get to explore, assemble, buy more music, and try to make it flow. It’s not perfect, but the goal is to always make it a little better than the last one. Hopefully I’ll be able to do one for October as well this year!
