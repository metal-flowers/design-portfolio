So much time passes between each DRONE(((E)))SCAPES, but that's okay, I do what I can! The only problem is I have to pick up where I left off and try to remember what I wanted to do next, but it comes back quickly. There are a few new things I tried with this track, and I'm kinda testing the waters of something else. What's beyond DRONE(((E)))SCAPES? Anyway, that tropical storm we had here in SoCal allowed me to finish this more quickly, and I used the timing of the new moon in Pisces as a deadline. Seemed fitting! Taking up space with 32 minutes of drone, which you can listen to on [Mixcloud]("https://www.mixcloud.com/aszaf/droneescapes-no-04/")

For the artwork, I modified _Reverie_ by Henri-Emile Lefort, c. 1852 - 1916. Typography is VCTR Mono v0.12 (previously ISO) by Vectro type.
