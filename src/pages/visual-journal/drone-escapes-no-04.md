So much time passes between each DRONE(((E)))SCAPES. The problem with the long span of time without working on these is picking up where I left off and trying to remember what I wanted to do next. With pure focus, it comes back fairly quickly though—fortunately. 

The recent tropical storm we had here in SoCal allowed me to finish this more quickly, and I used the timing of the new moon in Pisces as a deadline. Seemed fitting! There are a few new things I tried with this track, and I'm kind of testing the waters out for what could come next. What's beyond DRONE(((E)))SCAPES? We shall see. In the meantime, I'm taking up space with 32 minutes of drone, which you can listen to on [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/metal-flowers/droneescapes-no-04/).

For the artwork, I modified _Reverie_ by Henri-Emile Lefort, c. 1852 - 1916. Typography is VCTR Mono v0.12 (previously ISO) by Vectro type.
