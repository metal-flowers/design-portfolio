                   <h3 class="description-heading">About the Project</h3>
                        <p><em>Retirement Home</em>, is the second album from Bay Area band, Taxes. I worked closely with Robby Cronholm—the lyricist, frontman, and creative force behind Taxes—to bring the album to life in its physical and digital form. Using a commissioned painting from Sam Bee as inspiration and a starting point, I designed the packaging based on the tone of the album and the painting itself.</p>
                        <p>Together, this project consists of a designed 4-panel digipack, an 8-page saddle-stitched booklet of typeset lyrics, a logotype, and artwork for 3 digital single releases. The logotype for the album was created using Sometimes Times by Boulevard Lab, and the lyrics for the booklet were typeset in Wolpe Pegasus. </p>   
                        <p>This project holds a special place in my heart because it is the second album release I've designed for Taxes, the first one being, <em>It Never Ends</em>, <a href="https://redefinemag.net/2014/album-covers-of-the-year-2014-interviews/9/">back in 2014</a> when I was just 2 years into my career. Working with them, again, has been nothing short of amazing.</p>
