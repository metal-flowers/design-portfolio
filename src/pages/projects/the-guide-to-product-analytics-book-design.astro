    <h3 class="description-heading">About the Project</h3>
    <p>
      At Mixpanel, I led the design direction and print production of a
      high-quality perfect bound book. This book, <em
        >The Guide to Product Analytics</em
      >, was created out of the desire to repurpose a successful <a
        href="https://mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-analytics/intro/"
        target="_blank">digital guide</a
      > created that was published on <a
        href="https://mixpanel.com/"
        target="_blank">mixpanel.com</a
      > and bring it into print form. This book was created with the intention to
      be handed out at events, used for social campaigns, and to encourage product
      implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role for this project was the lead designer and project manager. I
      managed communication with the account manager at <a
        href="https://www.hemlock.com/"
        target="_blank">Hemlock Printers</a
      >, designed and typeset the book, created simplified product illustrations
      that appear throughout the book, selected print materials, approved the
      proofs, went on a digital press check, and ultimately saw this project
      through to the end with key teammates along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the process, I had design reviews with members of the design
      team, including product design for accuracy. After the book was in our
      hands, I worked with our marketing team at Mixpanel to get fulfillment
      organized with our third-party shipment vendor and collaborated with
      marketing and design to create assets for the book to be used across
      social, email, and on landing page order forms for customers across North
      America, EMEA, and APAC regions.
