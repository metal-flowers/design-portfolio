                   <h3 class="description-heading">About the Project</h3>
                        <p>At Mixpanel, I led the design direction and print production of a high-quality perfect bound book. This book, <em>The Guide to Product Analytics</em>, was created out of the desire to repurpose a successful <a href="https://mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-analytics/intro/" target="_blank">digital guide</a>  created that was published on <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" target="_blank">mixpanel.com</a> and bring it into print form. This book was created with the intention to be handed out at events, used for social campaigns, and to encourage product implementation.</p>
                        <p>My role for this project was the lead designer and project manager. I managed communication with the account manager at <a href="https://www.hemlock.com/" target="_blank">Hemlock Printers</a>, designed and typeset the book, created simplified product illustrations that appear throughout the book, selected print materials, approved the proofs, went on a digital press check, and ultimately saw this project through to the end with key teammates along the way.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the process, I had design reviews with members of the design team, including product design for accuracy. After the book was in our hands, I worked with our marketing team at Mixpanel to get fulfillment organized with our third-party shipment vendor and collaborated with marketing and design to create assets for the book to be used across social, email, and on landing page order forms for customers across North America, EMEA, and APAC regions.</p>
