    <h3 class="description-heading">About the Project</h3>
    <p>
      Type revivals embody a rich history in type design and play an essential
      role in the development of typefaces across changing technologies. They
      can be true to form like their original or take on new shapes and faces of
      their own—transforming into something quite different in the process. 
      <p>
        Beatrice No. 30 is a type revival, one that primarily stays true to its
        printed source, with a small number of design adjustments made during
        the interpretation and digitization process. Though revivals can often
        start with a known typeface from the metal type era, this revival
        started as an unknown—unstated in the selected source material from
        where it was found. However, after spending time with its magnified
        forms and reviewing 19th century type specimens, a close match pointed
        to Long-Primer, No. 20 from the Bruce Foundry in New York—where an old
        printed American edition of Dante Aligheri’s, <em
          >The Vision of Purgatory</em
        >, was also published.
      </p>
      <p>
        This classic piece of Italian literature, one of three parts to
        Aligheri’s <em
          >La Divina Commedia (Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso)</em
        >, was not only chosen for its typographic source material, but for its
        rich poetic symbolism, historical significance, and beautiful
        illustrations by <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9"
          target="_blank">Gustave Doré</a
        >—all of which helped provide inspiration and direction for this
        revival, despite being a great distance removed from its original
        manuscripts and early printed editions. On revisiting older, yet,
        tangible editions in the local library stacks, my focus shifted and
        centered around Beatrice rather than Virgil or Dante. Beatrice,
        referenced throughout the poem, can be seen as Dante’s love and divine
        guiding light on his journey to the heavens and the guide for this
        revival—Beatrice No. 30.
      </p>

      <h3 class="description-heading">About the Type</h3>
      <p>
        The type found in this 19th century American edition of Purgatory, was a
        journey of discovery in itself. The typeface used can be referenced as a
        transitional typeface, despite having old style qualities, including old
        style figures. The axis is vertical as visible in the ‘o’ and represents
        a shift away from the calligraphic hand and a step closer to modern
        typefaces like Bodoni. However, its primary characteristics remain
        closer to a Baskerville, making it more suitable for text due to its
        reduced contrast when compared to higher-contrast modern forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The color of the text on the page remains quite light due to the
        lightweight nature of the letterforms themselves, its generous spacing,
        which has been reduced slightly in the revival, and its moderate
        contrast. The letterforms carry more weight on top and bottom with its
        use of bracketed serifs and angled caps. The ball shape terminals are
        another defining feature, which remain in tact, but reduced in scale for
        improved readability for contemporary readers. Together, these details
        and characteristics allow for a clear and enjoyable reading experience
        that works best in text sizes rather than larger display sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In its current state, Beatrice No. 30 is limited to a single Regular
        weight and style in basic latin languages. An extensive character
        set with more language support, styles, and weights may potentially be
        added in the future to make it more applicable for varied use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beatrice No. 30, therefore, is unreleased and will remain as such until
        it meets a more complete and polished state. More importantly, it has
        been an incredible learning process; I know I will carry the knowledge
        and learnings with me into future type projects—which is what it's all
        about in these early stages.
      </p>
